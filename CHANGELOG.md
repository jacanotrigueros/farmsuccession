# Changelog

What changed, written for somebody deciding whether to trust the data rather than
for somebody reading the diff. Each entry says what became possible and what
became impossible.

Nothing is released yet: `master` holds no version, and the entries below describe
work merged into `develop`. The first release will be tagged when there is data to
release.

## Unreleased

### The data contracts

- Three schemas settled at `schemaVersion` 1.0.0: the territory catalogue, one
  territory in one year, and the research brief of a territory. Every property
  carries a description, every free-text field is bounded by a length measured from
  real values, and no property has a `default` — in a documentary schema a default
  is indistinguishable from a fact somebody read on a page.
- The types in `src/types/` are generated from the schemas and never edited by
  hand, so the data contract has one source.
- A field that describes one kind of resource can no longer appear on another: a
  training course cannot hand over plots of land, and a land bank cannot carry a
  financial mechanism.

### The territorial model

- Views are cumulative — EU, then country, then hub, then region — with one
  implementation, so a reader and a validator cannot disagree about what a
  territory inherits. A hub of one region is that region and carries no layer of
  its own.

### What can no longer be published

- A file whose path, own fields and the catalogue disagree about which territory it
  describes.
- A date after the day the file was written, a source consulted after it was
  published, or a review signed before the last source was read.
- A figure, deadline, percentage or contact detail in reader-facing prose that no
  quote, metric, date or URL of that file supports.
- A call marked open on a day its own source showed it closed, or marked upcoming
  after it had already opened.
- A resource that no lead in the territory's research brief admitted, or a lead
  admitted as a resource that no reader of that territory could see.
- Prose that names a schema code, a resource id, a territory slug or a repository
  path, or that reads as another of the catalogue's languages.
- A file carrying damage the parser hides: a repeated key that silently keeps only
  its last value, or a pasted fragment after the end of the document.

### The checks

- `npm run validate` — offline, part of `npm run check`, and therefore part of
  every push. It says how many files it read, so a run over nothing cannot be read
  as a clean run.
- `npm run check:sources` and `npm run check:links` — live. They re-read every
  cited page against its quotes, and ask every address the repository points at
  whether it still answers. They answer PASS, FAIL or UNCHECKED, and never gate a
  commit.
- `npm run check:territory -- <year> <territory>` — the gate for finishing one
  territory, where a warning fails too and a region must have answered every
  instrument its country brief expects.
- `npm run measure` — the distributions behind the thresholds, so a rule can be
  re-argued against the corpus instead of against preference.

### Written down

- [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md): why each non-obvious rule is the way it is,
  what the evidence said, what it costs and what would overturn it.
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and this
  file.

### The research pipeline

- `prompts/research-territory.md` is the standard process, and every version it
  went through is kept whole in `prompts/versions/`. A record says which version it
  followed, and the gate refuses a version the repository cannot show, so old work
  can be read against the instructions it actually had.
- `npm run prompt -- <year> <territory>` fills that process with the briefs, the
  resources of the layers above, the current file and the schemas. `--compact`
  names the shared files by path for an assistant that can open them.
- `npm run ingest -- <answer.md>` writes the files an answer delivered as fenced
  JSON blocks and then runs the whole gate, so an assistant with access to nothing
  can take part in the research.
- `npm run diff -- <from> <to>` says what changed between two editions, and the
  gate warns about the two ways continuity breaks: a record that vanishes instead
  of being kept as discontinued, and the same page returning under a new id.

### The first edition

- **The 2026 edition of the European layer and Spain**: 33 files, 132 records, 231
  sources, 651 quotes and 18 dated developments, plus the 33 research briefs that say
  how each territory was searched — including the 115 leads that were considered and
  rejected, which is the part that makes a second pass cheaper than the first.
- One commit per territory, edition file and brief together, so a research pass can be
  reverted on its own.
- Three sentences were corrected on the way in, each claiming a date that no quote of
  the file supported, and one rule was corrected because the data was right and the
  rule was wrong: a file's own voice may use the evidence of the layers it inherits,
  which is what a cumulative view means.
- The Asturian portal's incomplete certificate chain is completed by a third pinned
  public intermediate; the Gipuzkoa portals stay UNCHECKED, because trusting their
  root would add a trust anchor and that line does not move.
- Re-read live on 2 October 2026: 218 PASS, 1 FAIL, 11 UNCHECKED of 230 pages, all
  three published as they are.

### Not here yet

- France, Italy, Portugal and Germany: researched, not published here.
- The site, and therefore anything to visit.
